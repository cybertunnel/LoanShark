## What Should You Know Before Starting
LoanShark's goal is to provide a clean, secure and easy to manage method for handling an admin's loaner fleet.

By _easy to manage_ we mean:
- Ensuring little additional configuration is needed.
- Allowing entry level admins to be able to use LoanShark with no previous coding experience needed.

By _secure_ we mean:
- Ensuring only authorized users are able to manage the loaning period.
- Sandboxed
- [Developer ID](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) [Signed](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) application
