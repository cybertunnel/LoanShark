# LoanShark
LoanShark's goal is to provide a simple, yet effective management to your loaner fleet.
This utility allows you to:
- Lockout users after loaning period expires
- Provide custom loaning durations
- Enable users to remotely request loaning extensions

This currently supports Jamf Pro's interface for the Authentication piece.
