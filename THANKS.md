# Thanks
LoanShark wouldn't have been possible without the help of these folks

## Community
A huge thanks to the community on #LoanShark on the MacAdmins Slack, and especially:
- @ftiff
 - Used a variety of SplashBuddy code to speed up the process in development.
 - Helping assist in answering my long list of questions during this process.
- @jwojda
 - Willing to help test the early Alpha versions of LoanShark
- #swift on the MacAdmins Slack
 - Helping reduce the head injuries during development from banging my head on the wall(s)
